# XRController
This is my project creating an controller for XR. This controller is based on Arduino Feather Sense board and communicate with XR devices through Bluetooth Low Energy. The gestures sensing is performed using the gyroscope on the Feather Sense board along with two force sensitive resistors (FSR).
The FSRs are connected to the board as shown in the figure below:
